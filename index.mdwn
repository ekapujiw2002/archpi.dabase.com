# [Word sister](https://github.com/kaihendry/wordsister)

My sister needed a simple Webpage to add Wedding information upon. The options
sucked, so I wrote this.

1. It needs to be user friendly
2. Inline [edit page][1] functionality needed
3. Hosted on our domain

## Implementation

1. HTML isn't hard, but we've made it easier with Markdown with a [preview](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/)
2. Editing a page is accomplished by appending [/edit][1] to the URL
3. Git clone to your [VirtualDocumentRoot directory](http://dabase.com/e/04025/), and away you go. Needs PHP, `make` & a `markdown` binary.

<pre>cd /srv/www; git clone git@github.com:kaihendry/wordsister.git ws.dabase.com
cd ws.dabase.com; sudo chown -R :www-data .;  sudo chmod g+s .</pre>

## Demo

Resets on the hour: <http://ws.dabase.com/>
