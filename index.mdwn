# Word sister

My sister needed a simple Webpage to add Wedding information upon. The options
sucked, so I wrote this.

1. It needs to be user friendly
2. Inline [edit page][1] functionality needed
3. Hosted on our domain

## Implementation

1. HTML isn't hard, but we've made it easier with Markdown and a [preview application](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/)
2. Edit page is accomplished with appending [/edit][1] to the URL
3. Git clone to your VirtualDocumentRoot directory, and away you go. Needs PHP, `make` & a `markdown` binary.

<code>cd /srv/www; git clone git:///for-my-sister wedding.example.com</code>


  [1]: /edit/
