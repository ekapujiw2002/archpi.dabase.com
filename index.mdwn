# Simple Wiki

My sister needed a simple Webpage to add Wedding information upon.

1. It needs to be user friendly
2. Edit page functionality needed
3. Hosted on our domain

# Typical options

[Github pages](http://pages.github.com/) does not have an easy way to edit the Webpage. It does have a nice CNAME ability.

[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) is unsuitable since it's an absolute pain to setup.

# Implementation

1. HTML isn't hard, but we've made it easier with Markdown and a [preview application](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/)
2. Edit page is accomplished with appending /edit to the URL
3. Git clone to your VHOST directory, and away you go. Needs PHP, m4, make & markdown.
