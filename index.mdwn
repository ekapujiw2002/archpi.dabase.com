## What's this site???


Have you had an Archlinux ARM question, typed it into Google and didn't find an answer?

Perhaps you found the answer later. Either way, do let me know at hendry AT
iki.fi and I'll add it to the [site
source](https://github.com/kaihendry/archpi.dabase.com).

## Why Archlinux ARM ?

* Rolling release, more upto date
* Cleaner packaging
* [Systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) init by default

## Is there an official wiki?

Not specifically for Arm on Archlinux, though
<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Raspberry_Pi> is a good start since much
of the excellent Archlinux wiki applies to the <abbr title="Raspberry PI">rpi</abbr>.

## To login

User name `root` and password `root`.

Note that you really should disable ssh logins with that default:

	grep ^PasswordAuthentication /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	PasswordAuthentication no

## To update

    pacman -Syu

## To search for a package

    pacman -Ss $packagename

Refer to [pacman reference](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman) for more examples.

## How to ask for help

Setup your terminal to upload your console to share the output.

`curl http://archpi.dabase.com/tmux.conf > ~/.tmux.conf`

Run `tmux`. If it's not installed, installed it `pacman -S tmux`.

Now using tmux's default prefix of `ctrl+b` and the letter `p`, will upload your console to be shared.

To learn more about what tmux can do, have a look at its default key binds with `tmux lsk`.

## How to work out what your PI is doing

Run `top`.

## How to connect to your PI behind a Firewall?

See <http://pi.dabase.com/> for such a service.

## Is there an Archlinux ARM IRC channel ?

Yes, `irc://irc.freenode.net/#archlinux-arm`

## Is there an Archlinux ARM mailing list?

No there isn't, however there is an [annoying phpBB forum](http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=31) though.

## Wireless

`wifi-menu/netctl` is **the old way** and I would encourage you not to use it, though [I am biased](http://dabase.com/blog/Good_riddance_netctl/).

Sadly you need to `pacman -Syu wpa_supplicant` since it's not on the default
install image. I do this by temporarily wiring my <abbr title="Raspberry Pi">rpi</abbr> via the ethernet port.

`systemctl start wpa_supplicant@wlan0` will fail without a config as you can see from `systemctl status wpa_supplicant@wlan0` output.

	# cat <<EOF > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf
	ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant
	update_config=1
	EOF

And hopefully `systemctl start wpa_supplicant@wlan0` will now work.

`wpa_cli` to add a network. The user interface is unfortunately pretty awful.
Note you need to quote the essid and psk else it might fail:

	add_network
	set_network 0 ssid "MYSSID"
	set_network 0 psk "passphrase"
	enable_network 0
	save_config

Obviously check `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf` is looking correct.

See <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WPA_supplicant> for details. Once
setup, `systemctl enable wpa_supplicant@wlan0` to make sure it associates with
wireless on boot.

Finally you need to setup `systemd-networkd` for DHCP functionality like so:

	$cat /etc/systemd/network/any.network
	[Match]
	Name=*

	[Network]
	DHCP=both

And of course, enable it.

	systemctl enable systemd-networkd

Reboot to see if you device comes up online correctly!

## Working with <abbr title='General-purpose input/output'>GPIO</abbr> pins on a Rpi

Install `pacman -Sy wiringpi` and

	watch -n 0.5 gpio readall

See this [video a friend made of my living room light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEfofWLITJM).

Here is the systemd file that controls it:

	[root@rpi2 ~]# cat /etc/systemd/system/motionlight.service
	[Unit]
	Description=Turns light on thanks to motion
	After=network.target

	[Service]
	# Step 1: We invoke a shell to setup the GPIO and if motion is not detected, turn it off
	ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/gpio mode 0 out && test $(/usr/bin/gpio read 7) -eq 0 && /usr/bin/gpio write 0 1'
	# Step 2: If motion is detected, turn on the light
	ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/gpio wfi 7 rising && /usr/bin/gpio write 0 0'
	# Go to Step 1 after 5 minutes
	RestartSec=300
	Restart=always
	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target

## [PI Camera](http://www.raspberrypi.org/camera): Where is raspi{still,vid}?

[Rpi userland](https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland) is packaged as raspberrypi-firmware-tools.

	# pacman -Ql raspberrypi-firmware-tools | grep bin/raspi
	raspberrypi-firmware-tools /opt/vc/bin/raspistill
	raspberrypi-firmware-tools /opt/vc/bin/raspivid
	raspberrypi-firmware-tools /opt/vc/bin/raspiyuv

If you get:

	# /opt/vc/bin/raspistill -o image.jpg
	mmal: mmal_vc_component_create: failed to create component 'vc.ril.camera' (1:ENOMEM)
	mmal: mmal_component_create_core: could not create component 'vc.ril.camera' (1)
	mmal: Failed to create camera component
	mmal: main: Failed to create camera component
	mmal: Camera is not enabled in this build. Try running "sudo raspi-config" and ensure that "camera" has been enabled

You need to append to `/boot/config.txt`:

	start_file=start_x.elf
	fixup_file=fixup_x.dat

And `reboot`...

## Sending and receiving PI Camera video over the network

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/9417983903/" title="2013-08-01 16.55.38 by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7441/9417983903_0bd80c040c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="2013-08-01 16.55.38"></a>

Sending from the PI:

	/opt/vc/bin/raspivid -rot 180 -t 0 -fps 30 -b 2000000 -o - | gst-launch-1.0 -v fdsrc ! h264parse ! rtph264pay config-interval=1 pt=96 !  gdppay ! tcpserversink host=$pi_ip_address port=5000

On the machine you want to view the camera from:

	gst-launch-1.0 -v tcpclientsrc host=$pi_ip_address port=5000 ! gdpdepay ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink sync=false

## Using webp to save bandwidth

Install `cwebp` like so:

	pacman -S libwebp

	# cat capture.sh
	tmp=$(mktemp /tmp/XXX.jpg)
	webp=$(basename $tmp .jpg).webp
	raspistill -vf -o $tmp
	cwebp $tmp -o /dev/stdout
	rm -f $tmp

## How to stop console from blanking

	setterm -blank 0 >> /etc/issue

## No sound over HDMI?

Uncomment from `/boot/config.txt`:

	hdmi_drive=2
