## Why Archlinux ARM ?

* Cleaner
* Systemd init by default
* Easier to package and maintain

## Installing Archlinux ARM

After installing the latest [Archlinux ARM](http://archlinuxarm.org/) from [PI downloads](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads) you will find you only have a 2GB root. Expand it following this [guide](http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=3119).

## To login

User name `root` and password `root`.

## To update

    pacman -Syu

## To search for a package

    pacman -Ss $packagename

Refer to [pacman reference](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman) for more examples.

## How to ask for help

Setup your terminal to upload your console to share the output.

`curl http://archpi.dabase.com/tmux.conf > ~/.tmux.conf`

Run `tmux`. If it's not installed, installed it `pacman -S tmux`.

Now using tmux's default prefix of `ctrl+b` and the letter `p`, will upload your console to be shared.

To learn more about what tmux can do, have a look at it's default key binds with `tmux lsk`.

## How to work out what your PI is doing

Run `top`.
